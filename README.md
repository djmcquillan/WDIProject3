Present an idea to the instructors with a deck, covering the period of project inception, that includes:

<h2>a list of included technologies</h2>

<h2>a list of third-party APIs consumed </h2>
<p>We are accessing the YouTUBE api to pull TED talks into our app, and MEETUP to pull meetups in the local area that match the category for the TED video viewed.

<h2>which OAuth provider(s) your app will use for authentication</h2>
<p>We will use passport and then Passport-Meetup to allow users to login with MEETUP if they have an account</p>

<h2>wireframes for the central interactions</h2>
<p></p>
<h2>an underlying data model.</h2>
<p></p>

<li>Document your app's RESTful API.</li>
<li>Craft thoughtful user stories together, as a team, and manage and distribute those user stories to team members based on skills and interests using Trello.</li>
